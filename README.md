# WildWingsLegacy
A prototype iOS game using swift and SpriteKit

Originally made using Swift 1 to run on iPad. 
The code has been adjusted to run in Swift 4, but is not designed to take advantage of the more powerful features of Swift 4.
A complete rewrite of the project is intended.

This is a prototype, and is far from a well-structured or finished game. 
This is the first game i made, so the architecture of the code is likely not perfect for the required tasks.
